# Task05

A Point class, which models a 2D point with x and y coordinates should contains:

1. Two private instance variables x and y of int type.
2. A constructor that constructs a point with the given x and y coordinates.
3. A method getXYPairQ which returns the x and y in a 2-element int array.
4. A method called distance(int x, int y) that returns the distance from this point to another point at the given (x, y) coordinates.
5. An overloaded distance(Point point) method that returns the distance from this point to the given Point instance.
6. Another overloaded distance() method that returns the distance from this point to the origin (0, 0)

# Test01

Create a method for calculating an area of a rectangle
int squareRectangle(int a, int b), which should throw an IllegalArgumentException if at least one of its arguments is non positive. 

Create trySquareRectangle method which takes two parameters and calls squareRectangle to evaluate an area of a rectangle. Catch exceptions that can be generated.

trySquareRectangle shouldn't generate any exceptions. In case when one or two parameters are non positive the method should return -1.

# Task02

Create the static field cons of type Consumer and assign it the lambda expression that takes an array of doubles as a parameter and changes it using the next rule: all values that are greater than 2 should be multiplied by 0.8, and other values should be multiplied by 0.9.


Also implement a static method getChanged(...) that takes an array of doubles as a first parameter and Consumer implementation as a second. The method should return an array changed by the second parameter.


The getChanged(...) method should not change initial array.

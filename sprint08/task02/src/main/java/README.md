# Task02

Create annotation Review with two string elements: reviewer and date.

Element date has default string value today.

This annotation can be applied to class when we execute static method review(String className) of class Util and the result of this method will be printed Class <ClassName> was reviewed <date in format yyyy-mm-dd> by <reviewer> to standard output (console).

*If the class <className> isnâ€™t annotated we show message: Class <ClassName> isn't marked as Reviewed.

*If the class was not found we show message: Class <ClassName> was not found.

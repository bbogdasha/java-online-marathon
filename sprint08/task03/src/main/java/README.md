# Task03

Create single-value annotation TestSuite with default element that returns array of strings.
 Create class TestSuitHandler with static method run(Class<?> clazz).
This method invokes all public non-static zero args methods.


This method print to console information about all executed methods in form:

//   -- Method <class>.<methodname> started --
 
//<result of  methodname invocation>
 
//  -- Method <class><methodname> finished --
 
(before -- should printed tab character)

If clazz doesn't contain the <methodName> defined in annotation information Method with name <methodName> doesn't exists or not public in class clazz should be displayed.
If clazz is not marked with TestSuite annotation message Class clazz isn't annotated  should be displayed.

For example We have:

```java
  @TestSuite({"m1", "m2"})
  class Class1{
    public void m2(){
      System.out.println("Hello");
    }
  }
```

We run: TestSuiteHandler.run(Class1.class);

As a result we have:

//Method with name m1 doesn't exists or not public in class Class1

//	 -- Method Class1.m2 started --

//Hello

//	 -- Method Class1.m2 finished --
